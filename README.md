# GroupHub

Grouphub is a group sharing platform that allows users to create groups on popular platforms such as groupme or discord and share the link on one shared platform. Many of the common group communication platforms lack a way to search for groups which can make it very difficult to find and explore new communities. Grouphub acts as a way to address this problem by being the intermediary between groups and potential new members. Grouphub provides search for both users and groups which makes it easy to find what you're looking for. Grouphub also allows for public, private, and delisted groups which makes it easy to control how users see and access your groups.

Grouphub was developed using php and the laravel framework. The database is mysql. The frontend files were constructed using blade views in combination with bootstrap. Grouphub was hosted on an AWS ec2 instance and was reachable at grouphub.org. It has since been taken down due to server costs.
